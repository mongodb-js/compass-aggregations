> Compass Aggregation Pipeline Builder

- [`<Aggregation />`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations) Plugin for primary UI
- [`<ExportToLanguage />`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language) Modal plugin that connects `<Aggregation />` to `bson-transpilers` [for actual compiling to another language](https://github.com/mongodb-js/bson-transpilers)

## Compass Plugin Patterns

- `src/modules/` is where action happens
    - action creators components call
    - reducers that call dataService, window.open, emit to other plugins, etc.
    - follows the `ducks` pattern
- `src/stores/store` is where plugin listens+responds to events of interest from other plugins
- store is global state instantiated via `configureStore()`

## Cross-plugin Communication

> How does clicking on export to language button in aggregation builder show the modal that has code in it?

- `./src/modules/export-to-language.js` `appRegistry.emit('open-aggregation-export-to-language', generatePipelineAsString())`
- [`compass-export-to-language/src/stores/store.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language/blob/master/src/stores/store.js#L16) Listener for 'export to lang' event via appRegistry and renders its modal.
- [`compass-export-to-language/src/modules/export-query.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language/blob/master/src/modules/export-query.js#L56) has reducer for calling `bson-transpilers.compile()` which populates the code in the modal dialog.

## Usage with a `mongodb-data-service` Provider

See `./examples-data-service-provider.js` for details on what `data-service` functions are used and the applicable options for each.

## Contributing

If you're interested in helping with the Aggregation Builder plugin, we'd be over the moon excited! Here are a few ideas if you're interested but not sure where to start:

- [Add a new example aggregation](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/tree/master/examples#adding-new-examples)
- Additions/clarifications/improvements to `README`'s
- More tests (especially edge cases!)
- Generate `jsdoc` html to include in GitHub pages
- Improve build times (e.g. audit our webpack configs)

## Development

### Tests

```
npm run test
```

### Electron

```
npm start
```

### Storybook

```
npm run storybook
```

### Analyze Build

```
npm run analyze
```

## TODO

- [x] Verify Storybook not included in `production` bundle for Cloud
- [x] Switch Storybook deploy from `3.0.0` to `master`
- [x] Webpack 4 Upgrade #79 
- [x] Webpack 4 upgrade part 2 mongodb-js/compass-plugin#23
- [x] Fixed: Far too little docs for the amount of work...
- [ ] COMPASS-2888: Autocompletion includes projections #76
- [ ] COMPASS-2960: Autocomplete `$$variables` defined from `let`
- [ ] COMPASS-3086: Quickly create new pipelines by pasting into stage editor when in `INITIAL_STATE`

#### Misc

- [ ] input-docs uses sample size setting

#### Future

- [ ] Write some more tests for saving
- [ ] Save pipeline validation
